<h1>Emotional AI Detector </h1>
<h3>Project Description</h3>

The Emotional AI Detector is an AI-based system that detects three primary human emotions: Happy, Sad, and Normal. Using machine learning (ML) algorithms, the system analyzes input data (such as text, voice, or images) and classifies the emotional state of the user.

This project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of AI in emotion recognition, which can be applied in fields such as customer service, mental health, and interactive systems.
Features

    Emotion Detection: Detects emotions like Happy, Sad, and Normal from user input.
    Machine Learning Model: Uses a trained ML model to predict emotions.
    User-friendly Interface: Easy-to-use system for real-time emotion detection.

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>

    Python
    Machine Learning: (Scikit-learn)
    Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
    Data Visualization: Matplotlib (optional, if you visualize the data)
    Libraries: (e.g., OpenCV for image processing)

<h3>Installation</h3>

   <h2> Clone this repository:</h2>

    git clone https://github.com/padamdamai/Emotional-AI-Detector

<h2>Navigate to the project directory:</h2>

    cd EMOTIONAL_AI_DETECTOR

<h2>Create and activate a virtual environment:</h2>

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

<h2>Install the required dependencies:</h2>

    pip install -r requirements.txt

<h3>Usage</h3>

   <h2> Train the Model:</h2>
 If you are training the model, run the following command:

python train_model.py

<h2>Detect Emotion:</h2>
Once the model is trained, use the following command to detect emotions:

    python detect_emotion.py --input <your_input_data>

    You can replace <your_input_data> with the relevant input file (image, text, or audio).

<h3>Example Output</h3>

    Input: "I feel really excited today!"
    Predicted Emotion: Happy

Future Improvements

    Support for more emotions: Add more emotions such as Anger, Surprise, etc.
    Real-time emotion detection: Implement real-time emotion detection through webcam or microphone.
    Improved accuracy: Fine-tune the model for better accuracy and performance.
